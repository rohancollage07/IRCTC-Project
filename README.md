Frontend (Angular v17)
The frontend is developed using Angular v17, a powerful and efficient framework for building dynamic web applications. Key directories and files include:

src/app: Contains Angular components, services, and modules.
src/assets: Houses static assets like images and styles.
angular.json: Angular project configuration file.
Backend (Spring Boot)
The backend is built using the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable server-side architecture. Important files and directories include:

src/main/java: Java source code for the backend.
build.gradle: Gradle build configuration for managing dependencies.
application.properties: Configuration file for Spring Boot.
Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

Start the Spring Boot backend: cd backend && ./gradlew bootRun (or use gradlew.bat bootRun on Windows)
Start the Angular frontend: cd frontend && ng serve
Access the application at http://localhost:4200 in your web browser.
